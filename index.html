            Step 1: Firstly, we select an arbitrary vertex that acts as the
            starting vertex of the Minimum Spanning Tree. Here we have selected
            vertex 0 as the starting vertex.

            Step 2: All the edges connecting the incomplete MST and other
            vertices are the edges {0, 1} and {0, 7}. Between these two the edge
            with minimum weight is {0, 1}. So include the edge and vertex 1 in
            the MST.

            consider the edge {2, 3} and include that edge and vertex 3 in the
